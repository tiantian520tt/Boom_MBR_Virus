# Boom?A MBR Virus!
This is an MBR virus written in C + +. Its power can be imagined. It is being updated continuously.
# What should I pay attention to?
Be careful! Don't run it on your own computer. That's very unfriendly to your computer. Now, of course, there are ways to fix it. But there is no guarantee that we will not develop a very stubborn MBR virus in the future.
And don't use it illegally.
# How to compile it into an EXE file?
Do not use vscode and other software to compile it! The development environment is D E V-C + +, please use it to compile.
# How powerful is it?
After it runs on Windows XP and above, it will immediately modify the MBR boot area and shut down. After you restart: I'm a virus! Bye!
# Are there any available solutions?
You can download Windows PE and start it, repair hard disk partition, etc.
